Overview of the project

project: Simple calculator

Objective

objective of this project is to perform basic arithmetic functions, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The purpose of a calculator is to make it easier and faster to perform calculations, and to relieve the user from the need to do mental operations or use paperMore advanced calculators can perform more complex calculations, such as:
Square roots, Logarithms, Trigonometric functions, Exponential operations, Hyperbolic functions, Calculus, and Drawing function graphs. 
When numbers are entered into a calculator, the integrated circuit converts them to binary strings of 0s and 1s. The calculator then uses these strings to turn transistors on and off with electricity to perform the desired calculations.

key activities

The key activities of a simple calculator are to perform basic arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
Calculators are small, portable, and battery-powered, making them ideal for everyday use. More complex calculators can also handle square roots, exponential operations, logarithms, trigonometric functions, and hyperbolic functions

technologies used

Simple calculators use a variety of technologies, including integrated circuits, a keypad, a display panel, and a power source:
-integrated circuit

-power source

-display panel

-keypad
